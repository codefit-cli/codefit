# Changelog

All notable changes to codefit are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Pre-release.** The first tag is **`v0.1.0-alpha.1`** — the usable, dogfooded MCP
> core (deterministic detection + three surface categories + the `scan-all`
> three-bucket summary, over the MCP stdio transport `codefit mcp serve`). codefit is
> still in active development (Phase 1): baseline and `update` are stubs, and the
> HTTP/SSE transport plus Phases 2–4 are ahead. **`v0.1.0`** (no suffix) is reserved
> for **Phase 1 complete**. See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase 1: `codefit init`

- **`codefit init` is now functional** (was scaffolding). It does three jobs, all
  deterministic and LLM-free:
  - **Detect** the stack from marker files — language (`go.mod`, `package.json` /
    `tsconfig.json`), framework (Next/React/Express from `package.json` deps), ORM
    and database (Prisma schema + its datasource provider) — into a `.codefit.yaml`.
  - **Generate** codefit's own **thin** `SKILL.md` (Anthropic Agent Skills spec:
    `name` + `description`), with the detected language baked into the example
    commands. It triggers and points at the MCP tools; it does not restate what
    codefit already knows.
  - **Place** the skill where each detected agent finds it — Claude Code
    (`.claude/skills/codefit/`), OpenCode (`.opencode/skills/codefit/`), Codex
    (`.agents/skills/codefit/`). Agents are detected by file **or** dir markers
    (`CLAUDE.md` / `.claude`, `opencode.json` / `.opencode`, `.codex`). With no
    agent detected it falls back to `.agents/skills/codefit/` and says so.
- The agent → skill-path table lives in one place (`scaffold.AgentTargets`). The
  existing `.codefit.yaml` is never overwritten without confirmation (`--force`),
  and codefit never touches the user's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`. Every file
  created is reported — nothing is written silently.
- README gains a **Connect codefit** section with per-agent MCP server blocks
  (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex).
- Validated end-to-end on a real Next.js/Prisma backend (Bitácora): detected
  TypeScript / Next / Prisma / PostgreSQL and 27 route handlers, and placed the
  skill for Claude Code and OpenCode.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] — 2026-06-24

### Added — Phase 1: MCP stdio server

- **MCP stdio server** — `codefit mcp serve` exposes the engine over the Model
  Context Protocol (stdio), built on the official **MCP Go SDK** (`v1.6.1`,
  audited in ADR 0007). Tools registered: `codefit-scan-security`,
  `codefit-scan-all`, `codefit-scan-endpoint`, `codefit-surface-idor` / `-authz` /
  `-overfetch`, `codefit-confirm-surface`, `codefit-coverage`. Each is a thin adapter to the
  existing core handlers; no audit logic in the MCP layer. Verified by a
  client↔server protocol integration test (initialize → tools/list → tools/call).
  The HTTP/SSE transport (`--port`) is deferred.
- Go toolchain pinned to `go1.25.11` (the SDK requires Go 1.25+); minimum Go
  bumped from 1.24 to 1.25.

### Changed — Phase 1: scan-all actionable summary

- **`codefit-scan-all` returns a three-bucket summary instead of the full item
  dump** (ADR 0008). The response was large enough on a real backend (~101 surface
  items, ~80 KB) that MCP clients truncated it across 4 models. Now, split by facts
  codefit already computes: `actionable` — endpoints resolved locally with a gap
  (full detail); `resolved_clean` — endpoints resolved locally with no gap, controls
  present (named with a verification fact, **not** flattened with frontier, because
  a positive check is epistemologically opposite to a non-conclusion);
  `frontier_pending` — endpoints whose data left the handler body (named). When
  nothing resolved locally the frontier note states it is **not** a clean result. On
  the Bitácora backend: 80 KB → 24 KB (29.7%), 10 / 11 / 24. Breaking output change
  (`Endpoints` → `actionable` + `resolved_clean` + `frontier_pending`), acceptable
  pre-release.
- **New tool `codefit-scan-endpoint`** — re-analyses one file on demand and returns
  its endpoints' full concerns; stateless (re-runs the static analysis, stores
  nothing). Used to fetch the detail of a `frontier_pending` endpoint.
- **Frontier surface signals reworded as unresolved candidates.** The IDOR, authz,
  and over-fetching frontier signals (data left the handler body) were phrased
  around what codefit did *not* find ("No direct Prisma access detected", "could not
  check", "may be in a service/repository layer (follow … to confirm)"), which read
  as a negative result — in real dogfooding the agent discarded them as probable
  false positives. They now state the limit as an affirmation ("codefit does not
  follow calls across functions, so this is NOT verified here") and make following
  the data its own instruction. Detection is unchanged — the same items are
  enumerated; only the wording changed.

### Added — Phase 1: TypeScript security + surface mapping

- **TypeScript `LanguageProvider`** backed by gotreesitter (pure Go, no CGO —
  ADR 0002), behind the parser-agnostic `core/syntax.Node` AST boundary
  (ADR 0003).
- **Deterministic TypeScript security rules** — five categories asserted with
  certainty 1.0: hardcoded secrets, weak crypto (MD5/SHA-1, insecure
  `Math.random` for tokens), dangerous `eval`/`new Function`, inline SQL
  injection, inline XSS via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Declarative YAML in a
  Semgrep-format subset, matched by a pure-Go engine (`internal/core/ruleengine`)
  — no OCaml/OpenGrep embedded. Scope and known limits in `COVERAGE.md`. (ADR 0004)
- **Surface mapping framework** (`internal/core/surface`) — the product
  differentiator: `SurfaceItem` with a stable id and queryable `StructuralFacts`,
  the `Query` interface, and the stateless confirmation flow (the agent's verdicts
  become probabilistic findings, confidence < 1.0).
- **Three surface categories for TypeScript / Next.js / Prisma**, validated
  against a real backend: **IDOR** (id→resource endpoints), **broken
  authorization** (sensitive handlers), and **over-fetching** (domain-object
  serializations). Detection is by structural shape, never by name; the
  finite/infinite frontier is declared (ADR 0005).
- **`scan-all` synthesis** (`report.AggregateEndpoints`) — the complete picture
  aggregated per endpoint: deterministic findings and surface concerns of the same
  handler together, with three certainty levels (deterministic → surface-confirmed
  → frontier), the affirm/ask distinction preserved, ordered by actionable
  structural gap (never by severity). Agent-first JSON; a human renderer
  (`export-report`) is registered pending (PRD §27). (ADR 0006)
- **Coverage manifest** per provider (`COVERAGE.md`, derived from the in-code
  manifest) — declares what is audited deterministically vs reasoned over surface
  vs not covered, including the known limits.

### Added — Phase 0: foundations

- Three-layer architecture: `core/` (universal engine), `sensors/` (audit
  logic), `providers/` (per-language), so adding a language never touches the
  core.
- Project config parser (`.codefit.yaml`) with located validation errors and
  `path_criticality` support (RF-11).
- Core engine: filtering pyramid, content-hash cache, scoring, and the canonical
  JSON report (`schema_version` 1.0).
- **Go `LanguageProvider`** backed by `go/ast` (no CGO): static security and
  best-practice detectors.
- **Security sensor** (regex + AST layers) with severity adjustment by path
  criticality.
- Plumbing CLI built on cobra: `mcp serve`, `status`, and `version` work;
  `init` and `update` are scaffolding.
- Self-audit: codefit scans its own code in CI as a Go integration test.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for test/lint/build, goreleaser config, and weekly
  dependency vulnerability scanning (`govulncheck` pinned to v1.1.4).

### Changed

- **Architecture is MCP-first, pure.** codefit has no audit CLI and never calls
  or manages any LLM; the binary exposes only plumbing commands. The deterministic
  layers run in-process and the surface is returned to the agent, which reasons
  with its own model.

### Fixed

- Deduplicate overlapping layer-1 (regex) and layer-2 (AST) secret findings in
  the security sensor — closing a latent double-report that affected the Go
  provider too.
- `.gitignore` `coverage.*` was swallowing `coverage.go` source; narrowed the
  rule and added a CI guard against `.gitignore` swallowing source files.

### Notes

- `CGO_ENABLED=0` everywhere; cross-compiles to linux/amd64, linux/arm64,
  windows/amd64, darwin/arm64.
