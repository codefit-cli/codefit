# Changelog

All notable changes to codefit are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Pre-release.** No version has been tagged yet. codefit is in active
> development (Phase 1). It now runs over the MCP stdio transport
> (`codefit mcp serve`); the HTTP/SSE transport and Phases 2–4 are still ahead.
> The first tagged release will come once Phase 1 lands.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase 1: MCP stdio server

- **MCP stdio server** — `codefit mcp serve` exposes the engine over the Model
  Context Protocol (stdio), built on the official **MCP Go SDK** (`v1.6.1`,
  audited in ADR 0007). Tools registered: `codefit-scan-security`,
  `codefit-scan-all`, `codefit-scan-endpoint`, `codefit-surface-idor` / `-authz` /
  `-overfetch`, `codefit-confirm-surface`, `codefit-coverage`. Each is a thin adapter to the
  existing core handlers; no audit logic in the MCP layer. Verified by a
  client↔server protocol integration test (initialize → tools/list → tools/call).
  The HTTP/SSE transport (`--port`) is deferred.
- Go toolchain pinned to `go1.25.11` (the SDK requires Go 1.25+); minimum Go
  bumped from 1.24 to 1.25.

### Changed — Phase 1: scan-all actionable summary

- **`codefit-scan-all` returns an actionable summary instead of the full item
  dump** (ADR 0008). The response was large enough on a real backend (~101 surface
  items) that MCP clients truncated it across 4 models. Now: deterministic findings
  and the endpoints codefit resolved locally (`CertainConcerns>0`) go whole in
  `actionable`; frontier-only endpoints (the data left the handler body) are named
  in `frontier_pending` with a note and fetched on demand. The split is the fact
  `local_access_detected`, not an arbitrary cut. When nothing resolved locally the
  note states it is **not** a clean result. Breaking output change (`Endpoints` →
  `actionable` + `frontier_pending`), acceptable pre-release.
- **New tool `codefit-scan-endpoint`** — re-analyses one file on demand and returns
  its endpoints' full concerns; stateless (re-runs the static analysis, stores
  nothing). Used to fetch the detail of a `frontier_pending` endpoint.

### Added — Phase 1: TypeScript security + surface mapping

- **TypeScript `LanguageProvider`** backed by gotreesitter (pure Go, no CGO —
  ADR 0002), behind the parser-agnostic `core/syntax.Node` AST boundary
  (ADR 0003).
- **Deterministic TypeScript security rules** — five categories asserted with
  certainty 1.0: hardcoded secrets, weak crypto (MD5/SHA-1, insecure
  `Math.random` for tokens), dangerous `eval`/`new Function`, inline SQL
  injection, inline XSS via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Declarative YAML in a
  Semgrep-format subset, matched by a pure-Go engine (`internal/core/ruleengine`)
  — no OCaml/OpenGrep embedded. Scope and known limits in `COVERAGE.md`. (ADR 0004)
- **Surface mapping framework** (`internal/core/surface`) — the product
  differentiator: `SurfaceItem` with a stable id and queryable `StructuralFacts`,
  the `Query` interface, and the stateless confirmation flow (the agent's verdicts
  become probabilistic findings, confidence < 1.0).
- **Three surface categories for TypeScript / Next.js / Prisma**, validated
  against a real backend: **IDOR** (id→resource endpoints), **broken
  authorization** (sensitive handlers), and **over-fetching** (domain-object
  serializations). Detection is by structural shape, never by name; the
  finite/infinite frontier is declared (ADR 0005).
- **`scan-all` synthesis** (`report.AggregateEndpoints`) — the complete picture
  aggregated per endpoint: deterministic findings and surface concerns of the same
  handler together, with three certainty levels (deterministic → surface-confirmed
  → frontier), the affirm/ask distinction preserved, ordered by actionable
  structural gap (never by severity). Agent-first JSON; a human renderer
  (`export-report`) is registered pending (PRD §27). (ADR 0006)
- **Coverage manifest** per provider (`COVERAGE.md`, derived from the in-code
  manifest) — declares what is audited deterministically vs reasoned over surface
  vs not covered, including the known limits.

### Added — Phase 0: foundations

- Three-layer architecture: `core/` (universal engine), `sensors/` (audit
  logic), `providers/` (per-language), so adding a language never touches the
  core.
- Project config parser (`.codefit.yaml`) with located validation errors and
  `path_criticality` support (RF-11).
- Core engine: filtering pyramid, content-hash cache, scoring, and the canonical
  JSON report (`schema_version` 1.0).
- **Go `LanguageProvider`** backed by `go/ast` (no CGO): static security and
  best-practice detectors.
- **Security sensor** (regex + AST layers) with severity adjustment by path
  criticality.
- Plumbing CLI built on cobra: `mcp serve`, `status`, and `version` work;
  `init` and `update` are scaffolding.
- Self-audit: codefit scans its own code in CI as a Go integration test.
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions for test/lint/build, goreleaser config, and weekly
  dependency vulnerability scanning (`govulncheck` pinned to v1.1.4).

### Changed

- **Architecture is MCP-first, pure.** codefit has no audit CLI and never calls
  or manages any LLM; the binary exposes only plumbing commands. The deterministic
  layers run in-process and the surface is returned to the agent, which reasons
  with its own model.

### Fixed

- Deduplicate overlapping layer-1 (regex) and layer-2 (AST) secret findings in
  the security sensor — closing a latent double-report that affected the Go
  provider too.
- `.gitignore` `coverage.*` was swallowing `coverage.go` source; narrowed the
  rule and added a CI guard against `.gitignore` swallowing source files.

### Notes

- `CGO_ENABLED=0` everywhere; cross-compiles to linux/amd64, linux/arm64,
  windows/amd64, darwin/arm64.
